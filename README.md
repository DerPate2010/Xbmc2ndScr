==========
"XBMC Second Screen" is a companion app for the famous media center XBMC. You can control the media playback on your XBMC machine or any other media device in your network.
To use this app, you need a working XBMC installation. For the transcoding feature, you need a VLC as transcoding server on your XBMC machine.
